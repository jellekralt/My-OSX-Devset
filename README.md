My-OSX-Devset
=============

This repo describes my favorite tools and settings for web development on OSX (Node.js, JavaScript, SASS, ColdFusion, etc)
This list is ordered by installation order which I used the last time I reinstalled my system.

### [Brew](http://www.brew.sh)
Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple didnâ€™t.
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```

### [Node JS]



### Sass

### Compass


### [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

Although the editor is awesome, I really hate the icon, I solve this by replacing the default icon by [this beautiful icon](https://dribbble.com/shots/468176-Icon-Sublime-Text-for-themes-with-white-background) by [Dmitry Svetlichny](https://dribbble.com/vocaltsunami).

I also like to be able to run sublime from the terminal, if you follow [this explanation](https://gist.github.com/artero/1236170) you'll be able to run
```
sublime foldername
```
to open files / folders in sublime.

## Build tools
- [Yeoman](http://www.yeoman.io)
- [Grunt](http://www.grunt.io)
- [Gulp](http://www.gulp.io)


### [Growl](http://growl.info/)
"The Ultimate Notification System for OS X. Growl is the easiest way to know what's going on with your applications."
