My-OSX-Devset
=============

This repo describes my favorite tools and settings for web development on OSX (Node.js, JavaScript, SASS, ColdFusion, etc)
This list is ordered by installation order which I used the last time I reinstalled my system.

### [Brew](http://www.brew.sh)
Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple didnâ€™t.
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```

### [Node JS]



### Sass

### Compass


### [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

Although the editor is awesome, I really hate the icon, I solve this by replacing the default icon by [this beautiful icon](https://dribbble.com/shots/468176-Icon-Sublime-Text-for-themes-with-white-background) by [Dmitry Svetlichny](https://dribbble.com/vocaltsunami)
